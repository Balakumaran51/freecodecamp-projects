Data Analysis has been around for a long time. 
But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. 
But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, I have learn't the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. 
I know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.

## FCCproject1:Mean variance standard deviation calculator
### Project Description:
In this project I have to input a list of 9 elements and convert into a 3-dimensional [numpy](https://numpy.org "NumPy docs") array and calculate the row-wise,column-wise,
and total statistical constraints like mean,variance, ... etc. and represent them as the below code format. The main objective of this project is to have a good insight of 
the numPy module to calculate basic statistical constraints for furthur analysis of data and the following stepd.

The returned dictionary should follow this format:
```
{
  'mean': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'variance': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'standard deviation': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'max': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'min': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'sum': [axis1, axis2, flattened]
}
```
